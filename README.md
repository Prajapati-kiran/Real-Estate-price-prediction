# Real Estate Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This machine learning project focuses on predicting real estate prices using linear regression. Leveraging the power of data-driven insights, the goal is to develop a model that can accurately estimate property prices based on relevant features. This project is particularly useful for real estate investors, homeowners, and professionals in the industry seeking a reliable tool for price forecasting.

## Project Overview

In the realm of real estate, predicting property prices is a critical task influenced by various factors such as location, size, amenities, and market trends. This project employs linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, to establish a relationship between these features and the property prices. By analyzing historical data, the model learns patterns and trends, enabling it to make informed predictions for new or unseen data.

## Features

- **Linear Regression Model:** Utilizes a linear regression algorithm to model the relationship between independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (property prices).

- **Data Preprocessing:** Involves cleaning and transforming raw real estate data to ensure its suitability for training the model. This step includes handling missing values, and scaling numerical features.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Employs appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared) to assess the performance and accuracy of the linear regression model.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The project is implemented using the Python programming language, taking advantage of its extensive libraries for data manipulation and machine learning.

- **Scikit-Learn:** Leverages the Scikit-Learn library for building and evaluating machine learning models, including the linear regression algorithm.

- **Google colab:** Uses colab for interactive development, allowing for a clear and transparent presentation of data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model contains historical real estate information, including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant attributes.
You can find the dataset in this repository itself.

## Results

The linear regression model achieves accurate predictions, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing real estate prices. The results can guide stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding property investment and valuation.
